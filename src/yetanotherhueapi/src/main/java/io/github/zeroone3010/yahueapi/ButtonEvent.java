/**
 * <p>
 * This class describes an event of a single button of a switch. Depending on the device in question,
 * a button may only report when it is pushed down. Other kinds of devices will report the release of the button
 * separately, and still some other devices may report whether the button was held down for a short period
 * of time or a long period of time before it was released.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every button event has a numeric event code, an integer.
 * In case the device does not introduce all of its events to the Bridge, this library will not be able to know
 * about those events and will report them as the {@code UNKNOWN} type.
 * However, even in those cases one will be able to tell different {@code UNKNOWN} events apart by examining the
 * {@code eventCode}.
