   * These devices include at least the Senic Friends of Hue switch that has two rocker keys, i.e. four physical
   * buttons. However, when one pushes both rockers up (or down) simultaneously, the device logs events
   * from virtual buttons "5" and "6", which are never actually introduced to the Hue Bridge.
   * This library will handle those presses as "button number -1", but one will still be able to tell them
   * apart by inspecting the event code.</p>
   *
   * @return An integer describing the number of this button. If the device does not introduce all of its buttons
   * to the Hue Bridge, such buttons will have the number "-1".
